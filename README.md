- First, I experimented using bar graph to represent the time I spend on different things each day.

- I added some images. (use the image for study as an example)

- * Needs to be careful of the spellings - 'row.get()', the name in the bracket needs to match the name in the csv file. (Social media)

- Got all the images and arranged them to the place that were suitable for the chart.

- Created five squares to show the time amount by the colours. (the lighter the more time spent)

<img width="1134" alt="截屏2025-01-27 14 50 53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec89f803-f317-472c-9027-fdf2b2c67622" />

- Added explainations of the charts at the bottom right corner.

<img width="1389" alt="截屏2025-01-27 15 38 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d81735-baee-4fe7-ae8f-71d9763eada9" />
- Made a flashing chart to represent the overall time-spend.
- * Small squres - hours spent on each section
  * Size different - the amount of time
  * Different colours - to separate different sections

At last, added windowResized, and texts for more explainations.
